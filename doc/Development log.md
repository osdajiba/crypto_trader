### Development Best Practices

1. **Code Quality**

   - PEP 8 compliance enforced via `flake8`
   - Automatic formatting with `black` and `isort`
   - Type hints coverage >90% (checked via `mypy`)
2. **Testing Standards**

   - Unit tests: Pytest + hypothesis
   - Integration tests: Testcontainers
   - Performance tests: Locust + pytest-benchmark
3. **Security Protocols**

   - Secrets management: HashiCorp Vault integration
   - Input sanitization: Pydantic models
   - Audit logging: Immutable log streams
4. **Performance Optimization**

   - Async I/O for all network operations
   - Memory profiling with `tracemalloc`
   - Caching: Redis for frequent queries
5. **Documentation**

   - Code: Google-style docstrings
   - API: Auto-generated via FastAPI
   - User Guides: MkDocs with dark theme

### Contribution Workflow

1. **Environment Setup**

   ```bash
   poetry install --with dev
   pre-commit install
   ```
2. **Development Process**

   ```bash
   # Run full test suite
   make test-all

   # Generate documentation
   make docs-serve

   # Start development server
   make run-dev
   ```
3. **Release Management**

   - Semantic versioning (SemVer)
   - CHANGELOG.md updates required
   - GPG-signed commits for releases
